*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:

        #I used the workbench for some of these as a convenience (mainly when inserting/updating data)
        #I changed some minor details in the questions to fit the database that I created


*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

            SELECT * FROM flights WHERE date = "2021-03-04";

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day

            mysql> SELECT *
                -> FROM flights
                -> WHERE departure_city_id = "3" AND date = "2021-04-24"
                -> OR
                -> departure_city_id = "4" AND date = "2021-04-24";

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities on a specific day

            SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name
            FROM passengers p
            JOIN tickets t ON
            p.id = t.passenger_id
            JOIN flights f
            ON t.flight_id = f.id
            WHERE f.id = "1";

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

            SELECT first_name, last_name, c1.city_name AS Departure, c2.city_name AS Destination, flights.date
            FROM passengers
            JOIN tickets
            ON passengers.id = tickets.passenger_id
            JOIN flights
            ON tickets.flight_id = flights.id
            JOIN cities c1
            ON flights.departure_city_id = c1.id
            JOIN cities c2
            ON flights.destination_city_id = c2.id
            WHERE passengers.first_name = "Olivia";


*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday (I did on a specific day)



            SELECT first_name, last_name, c1.city_name AS Departure, c2.city_name AS Destination, flights.date
            FROM passengers
            JOIN tickets
            ON passengers.id = tickets.passenger_id
            JOIN flights
            ON tickets.flight_id = flights.id
            JOIN cities c1
            ON flights.departure_city_id = c1.id
            JOIN cities c2
            ON flights.destination_city_id = c2.id
            WHERE passengers.first_name = "Papa" AND flights.date = "2021-03-20";


*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year

            SELECT *
            FROM flights
            WHERE
            departure_city_id = "3" AND DATE BETWEEN "2021-04-01" AND "2021-05-01"
            OR
            departure_city_id = "4" AND DATE BETWEEN "2021-04-01" AND "2021-05-01";


*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year

            SELECT count(p.id) AS total_passengers
            FROM passengers p
            JOIN tickets t ON
            p.id = t.passenger_id
            JOIN flights f
            ON t.flight_id = f.id
            WHERE f.id = "2";


*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports

            INSERT INTO `efim_air`.`flights` (`departure_city_id`, `destination_city_id`, `aircraft_id`, `gallons_required`, `pilot_id`, `date`) VALUES ('3', '1', '2', '250', '3', '2021-05-05');

*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights

            INSERT INTO `efim_air`.`tickets` (`passenger_id`, `flight_id`) VALUES ('1', '9');
            INSERT INTO `efim_air`.`tickets` (`passenger_id`, `flight_id`) VALUES ('3', '9');
            INSERT INTO `efim_air`.`tickets` (`passenger_id`, `flight_id`) VALUES ('5', '9');
            INSERT INTO `efim_air`.`tickets` (`passenger_id`, `flight_id`) VALUES ('6', '9');


*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight

            UPDATE `efim_air`.`passengers` SET `meal_preference` = 'Keto' WHERE (`id` = '8');


*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
