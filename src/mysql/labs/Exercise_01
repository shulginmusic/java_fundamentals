 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

                 SELECT * FROM students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "CHEMISTRY" (choose a subject you included)

                SELECT * FROM college.teachers WHERE subject = "Chemistry";


 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

                SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name, t.subject, s.first_name
                FROM teachers t
                JOIN teachers_students ts
                ON t.id = ts.teacher_id
                JOIN students s
                ON ts.student_id = s.id
                WHERE t.first_name = "Walter";

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

                   SELECT t.subject, s.first_name
                   FROM teachers t
                   JOIN teachers_students ts
                   ON t.id = ts.teacher_id
                   JOIN students s
                   ON ts.student_id = s.id
                   WHERE t.subject = "Politics";

 *          e. update a record in the student table

                   UPDATE students SET age = '31' WHERE (id = 1);

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table

                   INSERT INTO teachers (`first_name`, `last_name`, `subject`) VALUES ('Ryan', 'Desmond', 'Java');

 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
